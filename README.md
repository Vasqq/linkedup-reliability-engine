# LinkedUp Reliability Engine

Welcome to the **LinkedUp Reliability Engine** repository

This project was developed for the **Flare x Encode Club Hackathon** and aims to provide a decentralized, verifiable system for tracking user reliability based on real-world activity check-ins. It showcases the innovative use of **Flare's FDC (Flare Data Connector)** protocols by bridging operational Web2 data (from a Flutter app backend) into verifiable Web3 reliability scores.

## About LinkedUp

LinkedUp is a mobile application (currently in development) designed to foster real-world social interaction through spontaneous and scheduled activities, particularly focused on sports. Users can:

View a map of nearby activities based on their location and interests.

Join ongoing or upcoming activities, or host their own.

Match based on interests, time availability, activity type, and participant limits.

Form groups, make friends, and build a network based on shared experiences.

Track reliability and participation over time.

Use cases currently include organizing pickup games for soccer, tennis, hiking, and other sports activities. Future expansions may allow for broader activities such as walking meetups, study sessions, picnics, and more.

While LinkedUp is not yet released publicly, its architecture emphasizes community building and real-world accountability.

The LinkedUp Reliability Engine in this repository extends the LinkedUp platform by **providing a decentralized, blockchain-verified method for tracking and rewarding user reliability**.

## Project Summary

### Problem:

Accountability and reliability are difficult to enforce in real-world social meetups. People often RSVP and then fail to attend, impacting the experience for others. Users have no easy way of knowing if the host or participants of an activity will actually show up, leading to wasted time and frustration.

### Solution:

The LinkedUp Reliability Engine introduces a decentralized, verifiable reliability score based on real-world attendance, creating a powerful incentive system. Users start with a baseline reliability score (50 points) that improves (+5) or deteriorates (-5) based on their attendance behavior. As users consistently attend activities they join or host, their score increases, signaling their reliability to others. Additionally, the weather conditions during the activity influence the magnitude of score changes: attending during adverse weather (e.g., thunderstorms) yields a greater positive impact, while missing activities under milder conditions results in a relatively larger penalty. This dynamic encourages commitment even under challenging circumstances.

When hosting an activity, a user's reliability score is publicly displayed to prospective participants. This allows participants to make informed decisions on whether to join, significantly increasing trust within the platform. Over time, higher reliability scores will become critical to building strong, dependable communities within LinkedUp.

Using attested activity check-in data from a Web2 database (Firestore), the system:

Prepares a verifiable attestation via Flare's Verifier API.

Posts this proof to the Flare blockchain (Coston2 testnet).

Updates user reliability scores on a custom smart contract.

The project is fully decentralized post-data publishing and offers a novel approach to bridging Web2 and Web3 user reliability systems.

> **Note:** LinkedUp (the mobile application) is still in development and has not yet been released. Live tests involving real users have been performed and are showcased in the video demo in the submission folder. 

This repository focuses solely on the backend reliability engine demonstration.

## Architecture Overview

```
LinkedUp App (private repo, separate)
  â””â”€â”€ Firebase Firestore (activity check-in data)
         â””â”€â”€ Firebase Cloud Functions (consolidates check-in data for the web2 api)
                  â””â”€â”€ Trigger Ngrok Local Server
                           â””â”€â”€ Hardhat Script (ReliabilityFdcProcessor.ts)
                                    â”œâ”€â”€ Prepare Attestation (Flare Verifier API)
                                    â”œâ”€â”€ Submit Proof (Flare FDC Contract)
                                    â””â”€â”€ Update Smart Contract (LinkedUpReliabilityBoard.sol)

```

The flow is fully automated:
- Every activity has a list of participants who checked-in on time
- Check-in data batches every 15 minutes.
- New snapshots are detected and processed.
- Proofs are verified and stored on-chain.
- Every users reliability score is updated based on their check-in data for the corresponding activity 
- Snapshots are marked as processed.

> Full diagrams and detailed code walkthrough are available inside the repository.

## Key Technologies Used

- **Flare Network** (Coston2 testnet)
- **Flare FDC Protocols** (prepareRequest, submitAttestation, retrieveProof)
- **Hardhat** (EVM development framework)
- **Firebase** (Firestore database + Cloud Functions)
- **Node.js** (Trigger server + processing scripts)
- **Solidity** (LinkedUpReliabilityBoard smart contract)

---

## Smart Contract - LinkedUpReliabilityBoard.sol

**Features:**
- On-chain storage of user reliability scores.
- Weather multipliers to reward check-ins under harsh conditions.
- Track total check-ins and misses for each user.
- Provide public views for reliability queries.

**Core Functions:**
- `updateReputation(proof)` â€” verifies and ingests attested data.
- `getReputation(uuid)` â€” fetches a user's current reliability score.

## How to Observe System in Action

This project operates using an internal, privately-hosted Firebase backend and a local server managed by the LinkedUp team.

Although public users cannot run the system locally, you can observe the on-chain updates in real-time by monitoring the smart contract activity.

Where to check:

Coston2 Testnet Explorer: Track reliability updates at Coston2 Explorer

Contract Address: 0x79e8066bB6638ADb91A2eCC8b6C7419102FD43a5

Transaction logs will reflect users' check-ins and the associated reliability updates processed by the Reliability Engine.

Note: Full control and execution of the Reliability Engine scripts remain internal for demonstration and validation purposes.

## Future Work

- **Expand reliability model:** Integrate additional on-chain/off-chain behaviors.
- **Show host reliability before joining:** Users will factor relaibility scorre into their decision to join an activity.
- **Optimized batching:** Improve snapshot aggregation efficiency.
- **Proof caching:** Add fallback mechanisms if DA Layer retrieval is delayed.
- **Production deployment:** Integrate with Flare mainnet once app is released and Flare brings jsonApi attestation type to mainnet

## Feedback on Building with Flare

The FDC was straightforward to integrate and very developer-friendly.

The Encode Club/ Flare tutorials were verusy useful

Having access to a JQ-based Verifier API made preparing attestations feel flexible and powerful.

The Coston2 testnet provided a reliable environment for testing my smart contract.

## Final Notes

The LinkedUp Reliability Engine demonstrates a **novel Web2 to Web3 bridge** for event-based reliability management. By leveraging Flare's infrastructure, it opens a path for decentralized trust models grounded in real-world actions.

We believe this project showcases the potential of Flare FDC and highlights the innovation possible when bridging traditional mobile apps with decentralized verification systems.
